FluidAudio is a Swift framework for on-device speaker diarization and audio processing, designed to maximize performance per watt by leveraging CoreML models exclusively. Optimized for Apple's Neural Engine, it delivers faster and more efficient processing than CPU or GPU alternatives.

Built to address the need for an open-source solution capable of real-time workloads on iOS and older macOS devices, FluidAudio fills a gap where existing solutions either rely on CPU-only models or remain closed-source behind paid licenses. Since speaker diarization and identification are among the most popular features for voice AI applications, we believe these capabilities should be freely available.

Our testing demonstrates that CoreML versions deliver significantly more efficient inference compared to their ONNX counterparts, making them truly suitable for real-time transcription use cases.

We are also working on adding support for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and VAD (Voice Activity Detection).

All models have been manually converted by our team from open-source variants and are available on Hugging Face.

## Features

- **State-of-the-Art Diarization**: Research-competitive speaker separation with optimal speaker mapping
- **Apple Neural Engine Optimized**: Models run efficiently on Apple's ANE for maximum performance with minimal power consumption
- **Speaker Embedding Extraction**: Generate speaker embeddings for voice comparison and clustering
- **CoreML Integration**: Native Apple CoreML backend with custom-converted models optimized for Apple Silicon and iOS
- **Open-Source Models**: All models are [publicly available on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/bweng/speaker-diarization-coreml) - converted and optimized by our team
- **Real-time Processing**: Designed for real-time workloads but also works for offline 
- **Cross-platform**: Full support for macOS 13.0+ and iOS 16.0+

## Installation

Add FluidAudio to your project using Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio.git", from: "0.0.3"),
],
```

## Documentation

See the public DeepWiki docs: [https://deepwiki.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio](https://deepwiki.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio)

## MCP

The repo is indexed by [DeepWiki](https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki-mcp) - the MCP server gives your coding tool access to the docs already.

For most clients:

    }
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Roadmap

**Coming Soon:**

- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Voice activity detection capabilities
- **ASR Models**: Support for open-source ASR models
- **System Audio Access**: Tap into system audio via CoreAudio

## üéØ Performance

**AMI Benchmark Results** (Single Distant Microphone) using a subset of the files:

- **DER: 17.7%** - Competitive with Powerset BCE 2023 (18.5%)
- **JER: 28.0%** - Outperforms EEND 2019 (25.3%) and x-vector clustering (28.7%)
- **RTF: 0.02x** - Real-time processing with 50x speedup

- **Efficient Computing**: Runs on Apple Neural Engine with zero performance trade-offs

```text
  RTF = Processing Time / Audio Duration

  With RTF = 0.02x:
  - 1 minute of audio takes 0.02 √ó 60 = 1.2 seconds to process
  - 10 minutes of audio takes 0.02 √ó 600 = 12 seconds to process

  For real-time speech-to-text:
  - Latency: ~1.2 seconds per minute of audio
  - Throughput: Can process 50x faster than real-time
  - Pipeline impact: Minimal - diarization won't be the bottleneck
```

## üè¢ Real-World Usage

FluidAudio powers production applications including:

- **[Slipbox](https://slipbox.ai/)**: Privacy-first meeting assistant for real-time conversation intelligence
- **[Whisper Mate](https://whisper.marksdo.com)**: Transcribe movie/audio to text locally. Realtime record & transcribe from speaker or system apps. üîí All process in local mac Whisper AI Model.

## Quick Start

```swift
import FluidAudio

// Initialize and process audio
Task {
    let diarizer = DiarizerManager()
    try await diarizer.initialize()

    let audioSamples: [Float] = // your 16kHz audio data
    let result = try await diarizer.performCompleteDiarization(audioSamples, sampleRate: 16000)

    for segment in result.segments {
        print("\(segment.speakerId): \(segment.startTimeSeconds)s - \(segment.endTimeSeconds)s")
    }
}
```

## Configuration

Customize behavior with `DiarizerConfig`:

```swift
let config = DiarizerConfig(
    clusteringThreshold: 0.7,      // Speaker similarity (0.0-1.0, higher = stricter)
    minActivityThreshold: 10.0,    // Minimum activity frames for speaker detection
    minDurationOn: 1.0,           // Minimum speech duration (seconds)
    minDurationOff: 0.5,          // Minimum silence between speakers (seconds)
    numClusters: -1,              // Number of speakers (-1 = auto-detect)
    debugMode: false
)
```

## CLI Usage

FluidAudio includes a powerful command-line interface for benchmarking and audio processing:

### Benchmark with Beautiful Output

```bash
# Run AMI benchmark with automatic dataset download
swift run fluidaudio benchmark --auto-download

# Test with specific parameters
swift run fluidaudio benchmark --threshold 0.7 --min-duration-on 1.0 --output results.json

# Test a single file for quick parameter tuning  
swift run fluidaudio benchmark --single-file ES2004a --threshold 0.8
```

### Process Individual Files

```bash
# Process a single audio file
swift run fluidaudio process meeting.wav

# Save results to JSON
swift run fluidaudio process meeting.wav --output results.json --threshold 0.6
```

### Download Datasets

```bash
# Download AMI dataset for benchmarking
swift run fluidaudio download --dataset ami-sdm
```
